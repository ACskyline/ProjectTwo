ProjectTwo is the result of a gamejam.

The theme of that gamejam is a geometry shape which looks like "#".

In Chinese, "¶þ" means "two", so that is where the name ProjectTwo come from.

Also, in Chinese, "¾®" means "well(water well)", which looks pretty like "#", so that is the whole game idea comes from.
If you fall in to the well, you are done.
